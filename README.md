## How it works

1. Signup/login to your account
2. Join a group with your friends by entering a common group `id`
3. Set your preferences, i.e. `location`, `search term`, `budget`, `max distance away`
4. Start the voting when everyone is present and ready
5. Go through a list of restaurants and view details about them, such as `distance away`, `rating`, `phone number` etc.
6. Once everyone has finished voting, the restaurant with the highest votes will be shown to the group! 🥂
